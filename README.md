# ZPlayed
A tiny media player designed by Trangle 
to be extra small. ZPlayer interfaces 
with Windows Media Player to play a variety
of audio files. It is designed to run in
the background and, without a user interface,
be very hard to pause or terminate. The 
uses for such a program might be playing 
audio files on a low-end PC, or minimizing 
interuption of an audio track.
